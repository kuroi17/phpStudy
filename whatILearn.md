october 27 2025 - i have learn the basic syntax and fundamentals of the php 
as well as i have learn the basic form handling and i also learn that using backend is better for security than using frontend
Backend Security Tips:
-Use htmlspecialchars when it comes to input handling in order to prevent the hackers to inject script in the form or input handler
-"required" html attribute in the form as a form of frontend is not advised as the user can just remove the required in inspect or dev tools
- use POST method
- use header() and exit();
